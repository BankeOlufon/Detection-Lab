# Home Lab

## Objective

To simulate a real-world network environment for hands-on practice in threat detection, network security, and system hardening. The lab includes virtual machines running Windows and Linux, a firewall (pfSense), and open-source security tools like Wireshark, and Kali Linux. This environment is used to safely test attack and defense techniques, monitor network traffic, and improve my practical cybersecurity skills.
